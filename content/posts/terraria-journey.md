### 01-01-2024

I have been playing terraria for a few weeks now. Terraria is a 2D minecraft like game, where you mine stuff in the morning and fight demons in the night. Its kind of cool, it has a lot of secret things that the player has to unravel. Its kind of fun.

I am not much of a genius so I usually end up reading on how to do certain things online, as I find it hard to figure it out myself.

#### How I started playing terraria?

I got hooked on games after I saw the trailer for the game "Cuphead". I was kind of burnt out in the job I was in back then and I wanted some time off, so I decided to leave that job and pursure game development. As a go away gift one of my mentors gifted me with the game terraria. He said, if he had got this game when he was a kid, he would have played it all day long.

When I was jobless at my parents house, I tried my hand at streaming gameplays on twitch. I started playing Terraria during one of my twitch stream sessions. A few of my twitch viewers decided to do co-op and they came into my terraria world. One of the folks was a terraria veteran, and that person just went crazy with the drops, they unlocked everything for me in a few minutes of game play and I even fought with the eye of cthulu. But after a while my laptop server started maxing out and I had to end my twitch session and I didn't play terraria for a long time after that.

But I got to understand how cool terraria was back then and I wanted to unravel its secrets and progression by myself without being handed everything on a platter. The concept of doing certain things to obtain an item is so close to some thing from real life and it makes sense to me and I want to play this game because of that.

#### Back to my current progress

As of the first day of the year 2024, I got an anvil, have a few houses, have explored 2 sky islands, have ridden in the underground railway as long the rails were there, got some christmas gifts and have bought some piggy banks to store some of my money and other useless junk.

During my visit to the sky islands, I got to replace my default weapons with some good weapons from the chests that were in the houses made of gold there. Now I am able to beat the monsters of the night with ease.

#### Things I am looking forward to

- I still have not found a crystal heart, I will be needing it to increase my life count. 
- Fight the eye of cthulu or some boss
- Get some wings
