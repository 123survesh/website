Hi. A common pattern I noticed was that the people around me got tired easily and found my rants quite boring. But I have these things in my mind that I want to say out loud. So instead of pestering the ears of my neighbouring humans, I have decided to type away on the internet, where people decide what data they want to consume (or atleast think they do).
And thus we start on this glorious journey of me dumping my thoughts on the most random things that I live through. Thanks Internet!!
