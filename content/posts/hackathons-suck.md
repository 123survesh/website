The last hackathon I was part of was in 2020, it was technically a [game jam](https://github.com/123survesh/The-Office), but what the hell it was a hackathon nonetheless. I have been part of very few hackathons in my lifetime and I believe I am a person who just hates hackathon or someone who doesn't like hackathons or atleast some aspects of a hackathon.

### Why hackathons suck?

Usually hackathons involve creating a product in a very short amount of time and non stop work for x amount of days and nights. I feel burnt out and quite sick after hackathons. It sucks the soul from the things that one is passionate about in a fancy setting with carbonated drinks, cold and dry bread based food.

### My verdict

Instead of competing and racing against time to create a product, I would rather prefer coding something useful with people whom I can vibe with, in a chill setting.
