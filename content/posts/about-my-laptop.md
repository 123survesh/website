I write this blog on an old dell laptop that I have borrowed from my aunt (thanks chithi). 

### Side tangent about my personal laptop
I broke the screen on my laptop when I was travelling in my college bus sometime during the second year. It was a sad day. I was using my laptop with an external monitor (Samsung 21 inch LED) for a long time. Then I broke my external monitor during covid. I had kept it on a cardboard box, the cardboard box's integrity got compromised during the rainy season and my monitor fell down and didn't work after that. Now it sits in my parents house collecting dust.

### Back to my Aunt's Laptop...

#### Aunt's Laptop Spec:
- Manfacturer : Dell
- CPU: Intel I3-3227U 1.90Ghz x 4
- Memory: 5.7GB
- OS: Debian GNU 11 (bullseye)
- Desktop Environment: XFCE 4

The laptop came with Window's 8 I believe, windows was good and decently fast. But there were updating issues that was slowing down the experience. So I replaced it with Debian and XFCE. Its pretty decent now, a few keys don't work well and the down arrow key tends to stick from time to time, but other than that its good. I use it for watching movies and playing games and the occational coding and blogging.

#### Games I have tried on this laptop:
- [Terraria](https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/) (2D - Minecraft like game)
- [Enter the Gungeon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/311690/Enter_the_Gungeon/) (2D - Rogulike shooting game)
- [Psychonauts](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3830/Psychonauts/) (stopped playing due to camera drifting issue)
